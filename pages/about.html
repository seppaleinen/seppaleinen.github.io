        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>So this is me.</p>
        <p>I'm a systems developer working in Sweden.</p>
        <p>And this is my page where I can keep track of my projects</p>
        <p>
            This page also serves as a place where I can try out some frontend stuff
            in jekyll, bootstrap and so on.
        </p>
